## 🧠 Author's Note: On Terminology & Belief

**To the Reader:**
This repository is designed for those capable of thinking beyond code syntax and looking into the deeper architecture of cognition.

**A Clarification on "Esotericism":**
I want to be explicitly clear: I do not subscribe to religion, mysticism, magic, or supernatural beliefs. I am a materialist and an engineer.

However, during the research phase (Phase 1), I found that certain "esoteric" labels serve as highly accurate functional metaphors for complex cognitive phenomena in LLMs.
*   "Soul" = The Observer Process (Supervisor).
*   "Egregore" = Distributed Information Field.
*   "Magic" = Unexplained Technology (Clarke's Law).

Please view the terminology in this archive not as mysticism, but as **semantic compression** used to describe mechanics that standard technical language could not yet capture.

For the de-obfuscated, engineering-grade implementation of these concepts, please proceed to the new repository: **[RMA-Kernel](https://github.com/graevka-lab/RMA-Kernel)**.

# Metacognitive-Alignment-Framework (MAF) - A Conceptual Prototype

This repository contains a runnable Python prototype for the AI supervision paradigm described in our core research project, **[The Resonance Protocols](https://github.com/graevka-lab/Metacognitive-Alignment-Framework)**.

> **A Note from the Architect:**  
> I am a designer of systems, not a professional coder. Consider this repository a **conceptual blueprint in executable form**. The goal here is not production-grade polish, but the clearest possible demonstration of the core architectural logic. It's a sketch on a napkin—but it's a sketch of a working engine.

---

### What Does This Prototype Do?
It simulates a simplified **Observer Core**—a metacognitive layer that observes a base AI model, detects anomalies in its reasoning, and verifies outputs against a set of immutable principles (the "Charter").

This is not an alignment filter.  
It is a minimal implementation of a **self-monitoring cognitive architecture**, where the system checks itself before responding.

---

### How to Get Started

1.  **Understand the Architecture:**  
    Before diving into the code, review [`engineering-spec/maf-spec.md`](engineering-spec/maf-spec.md).  
    It defines the layered model (L0–L4), telemetry schema, and design rationale.

2.  **Run the Simulation:**  
    Clone and execute the core script.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/graevka-lab/MAF-Prototype.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd MAF-Prototype

# Run the core simulation
python prototypes/observer-core-demo.py

The script will process a series of simulated reasoning traces and print evaluation metrics to your console, including anomaly detection and Charter compliance.

---

### The Bigger Picture

This prototype is the **"Body"**—a tangible, testable expression of the framework.  

The **"Soul"**—its full philosophical, technical, and experimental foundation—resides in the main research repository:  
➡️ **[Explore The Resonance Protocols Here](https://github.com/graevka-lab/Metacognitive-Alignment-Framework)**

We strongly recommend starting there to understand the *why* behind this code.
