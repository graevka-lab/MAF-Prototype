# Metacognitive-Alignment-Framework (MAF) - A Conceptual Prototype

This repository contains a runnable Python prototype for the AI supervision paradigm described in our core research project, **The Resonance Protocols**.

**A Note from the Architect:**
> I am a designer of systems, not a professional coder. Consider this repository a **conceptual blueprint in executable form**. The goal here is not production-grade polish, but the clearest possible demonstration of the core architectural logic. It's a sketch on a napkin, but it's a sketch of a working engine.

### What Does This Prototype Do?
It simulates a simplified **Observer Core** — a metacognitive layer that watches a base AI model, detects anomalies in its reasoning, and verifies its output against a set of immutable principles (the "Charter").

### How to Get Started

1.  **Understand the Architecture:** Before diving into the code, review the **[`engineering-spec/maf-spec.md`](engineering-spec/maf-spec.md)**. It outlines the layered model and core concepts.

2.  **Run the Simulation:** Clone this repository and run the main script.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/graevka-lab/MAF-Prototype.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd MAF-Prototype

# Run the core simulation
python prototypes/observer-core-demo.py
```

This will run a series of simulated "traces" and print the evaluation results to your console.

The Bigger Picture
This prototype is the "Body". The "Soul" of the project—its full philosophical and theoretical rationale—resides in the main research repository. We strongly recommend starting there to understand the "why" behind this code.
